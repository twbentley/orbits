DSA2 Project in OpenGL - by Thomas Bentley and Jacob Burdecki

------

This project is a summation of tech demos built in C++ and with Processing.

It is primarily a demonstration of use of OpenGL to render 3D and 2D objects or varying resolution.
The mechanics include graviation betweem similar sized bodies, use of orbital algorithms to generate
	solar systems, elliptical orbits, and moons, and sphere to sphere collision detection and response.
	Also included is a demo of a bezier surface and of a camera that makes use of quaternions to
	rotate. Note that these last two features were nearly complete examples given via educational
	contacts, and the developers take no credit for the initial research behind either.

The orbital mechanics can be explored by changing the value of systemState in Source.cpp ( ~line 313 )
	OR they can be explored in the processing prototype.

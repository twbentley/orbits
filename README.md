DSA2 Project in OpenGL - with Jacob Burdecki

This project is a summation of tech demos built in C++ and with Processing.

It is primarily a demonstration of use of OpenGL to render 3D and 2D objects or varying resolution.
The mechanics include graviation betweem similar sized bodies, use of orbital algorithms to generate
  solar systems, elliptical orbits, and moons, and sphere to sphere collision detection and response.
  Also included is a demo of a bezier surface and of a camera that makes use of quaternions to
  rotate, although these two
